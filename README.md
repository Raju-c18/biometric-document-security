# Biometric-Based Secure Document Access System

## 📖 Overview
This project implements a **secure document access system** using **biometric authentication** and **encryption techniques**. It combines **iris and fingerprint verification** with **Rubik’s Cube–based encryption** and **OTP verification** to ensure that only authorized users can access sensitive documents.

## 🔐 Key Features
- Iris-based user authentication
- Fingerprint-based user authentication
- Multi-biometric verification for higher security
- Rubik’s Cube encryption for document protection
- OTP verification using Telegram API
- Secure encryption and decryption of documents
- Alert system for unauthorized access attempts

---

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** OpenCV, NumPy
- **Security:** Rubik’s Encryption Algorithm
- **Authentication:** Iris and Fingerprint Biometrics
- **OTP Service:** Telegram Bot API
- **Platform:** Windows

## ⚙️ System Workflow
1. User uploads a document for secure storage.
2. Iris and fingerprint images are captured.
3. Biometric features are verified against registered data.
4. If authenticated, an OTP is sent to the registered Telegram account.
5. After OTP verification, the document is encrypted using Rubik’s algorithm.
6. For access, the same biometric and OTP verification process is followed.
7. Document is decrypted only for authorized users.
